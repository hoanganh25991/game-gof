# Skill Assignment UI Update

## Summary
Updated the skill assignment flow in the Hero screen and preview functionality to improve user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hero Screen - Skills Tab (`src/ui/hero/tabs/skills.js`)

**Before:**
- When clicking "Assign" button, an inline bar appeared at the bottom showing Q/W/E/R buttons
- User had to click one of the buttons to assign the skill

**After:**
- When clicking "Assign" button, a modal overlay appears (similar to preview.js)
- Modal shows:
  - Skill name and icon being assigned
  - Grid of Q/W/E/R buttons with current skill names below each
  - Keyboard shortcuts (press Q/W/E/R directly)
  - Cancel button and ESC key support
- More intuitive and consistent with the preview flow

**Key Features:**
- âœ… Modal-based assignment (replaces inline bar)
- âœ… Shows current skill bindings for each key
- âœ… Keyboard shortcuts (Q/W/E/R to select, ESC to cancel)
- âœ… Hover effects on buttons
- âœ… Async/await pattern for clean code flow
- âœ… Proper cleanup of event listeners

### 2. Preview Functionality (`src/ui/hero/preview.js`)

**Before:**
- When clicking preview button in Book tab, modal asked which key to assign
- User had to select Q/W/E/R before seeing the preview
- Skill was permanently assigned to the selected key

**After:**
- When clicking preview button, NO modal appears
- Automatically finds the key with the least cooldown
- Temporarily assigns skill to that key for preview only
- After preview, restores the original skill binding
- User can preview without affecting their loadout

**Key Features:**
- âœ… No key selection modal for preview
- âœ… Automatic key selection (least cooldown)
- âœ… Temporary assignment (doesn't persist)
- âœ… Original skill restored after preview
- âœ… Smooth countdown and casting animation

**New Helper Function:**
```javascript
findKeyWithLeastCooldown(skills)
```
- Iterates through Q/W/E/R keys
- Finds the one with minimum cooldown remaining
- Returns the best key for immediate casting

**Updated Function:**
```javascript
showCastingOverlayAndCast(skills, def, key, persist = true)
```
- Added `persist` parameter (default: true)
- When `persist = false`: temporarily assigns skill, then restores original
- When `persist = true`: permanently assigns skill (original behavior)

## User Experience Improvements

### Skills Tab Assignment:
1. Click "Assign" button on any skill
2. Modal appears with clear options
3. See current bindings for each key
4. Press Q/W/E/R or click button
5. Skill is assigned immediately
6. Modal closes automatically

### Book Tab Preview:
1. Click "Preview" button on any skill
2. Hero screen fades out
3. Countdown appears (based on cooldown)
4. Skill is cast automatically
5. "ðŸ”¥ Casted!" confirmation
6. Hero screen fades back in
7. Original loadout unchanged

## Technical Details

### Modal Implementation:
- Fixed position overlay with backdrop blur
- Z-index: 9999 (above all other UI)
- Responsive design (max-width: 90vw)
- System font stack for consistency
- CSS variables for theming
- Proper event listener cleanup

### Cooldown Selection Logic:
- Checks all 4 keys (Q/W/E/R)
- Calculates remaining cooldown for each
- Selects key with minimum wait time
- Ensures immediate or fastest preview

### Skill Restoration:
- Stores original skill before preview
- Temporarily sets preview skill
- Casts the skill
- Restores original skill after cast
- No side effects on loadout

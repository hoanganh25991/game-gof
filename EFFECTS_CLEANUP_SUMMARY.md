   - Now handled by: Individual skill effects create custom spirals

2. **`spawnCone()`** - Lines 378-400 (23 lines)
   - Was used for: Fountain/geyser cone effects
   - Now handled by: Skills create custom cone geometries

3. **`spawnShockwave()`** - Lines 405-423 (19 lines)
   - Was used for: Expanding ring shockwaves
   - Now handled by: Skills create custom expanding rings

4. **`spawnParticleBurst()`** - Lines 428-464 (37 lines)
   - Was used for: Particle explosions
   - Now handled by: Skills manage their own particle systems

5. **`spawnPillar()`** - Lines 469-501 (33 lines)
   - Was used for: Vertical column effects

6. **`spawnLightning()`** - Lines 506-560 (55 lines)
   - Was used for: Lightning bolt effects with branches
   - Now handled by: Skills create custom jagged paths

**Total removed:** ~200 lines of unused code

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Approach

All skill effects now follow these patterns:

### Direct THREE.js Geometry Creation
- `SphereGeometry` - For cores, particles, orbs
- `CylinderGeometry` - For pillars, columns, spouts
- `ConeGeometry` - For flames, eruptions
- `TorusGeometry` - For rings, spirals
- `CircleGeometry` - For ground effects, craters
- `RingGeometry` - For expanding waves, halos
- `BoxGeometry` - For beams, cracks, debris
- `BufferGeometry` - For custom paths, spirals

### Custom Animation Loops
- Using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animations
- Progress tracking with conditional rendering
- Multi-stage animations with staggered timing
- Pulsing/flickering effects using `Math.sin`

### Particle Systems
- Using `baseEffects.queue` for particle management
- Velocity and gravity for realistic physics
- Continuous particles for auras (reset when reaching max height)
- Burst particles for explosions

### Proper Cleanup
- Disposing geometries and materials to prevent memory leaks
- Removing objects from scene when animation completes
- Canceling animation frames on cleanup

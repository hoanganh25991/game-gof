## Quick Start

This project is static (no build step). Serve the root directory with any static file server to enable ES module imports.

Examples:
- Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Node: `npx http-server -p 8000`

Then open:
- http://localhost:8000 (or the port you chose)

## Gameplay Overview

- Player (GoT) moves with RTS‑style orders and auto‑attacks when in range.
- Enemies aggro, chase, attack, or wander when idle.
- Four skills with cooldowns and mana:
  - Q Chain Lightning (chains targets in range)
  - W Lightning AOE (damages + applies slow)
  - E Static Field Aura (periodic ticks, drains mana)
  - R Thunderstorm (random strikes over time)
- HUD shows HP/MP/XP/Level; cooldown wedges display time remaining.
- Minimap shows player, enemies, village ring, and portals.
- Recall (B) spawns a return portal; click it to travel to the village; regen is boosted in the village ring.
- On death, auto‑respawn in the village after a short delay.
